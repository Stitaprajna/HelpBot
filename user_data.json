This ensures the maximum accuracy of trading operations and reduces the likelihood of a repeat operation. On a one click trading system, traders use a special panel that has a special window named tester where all settings are stored. In this window, you can find out more about the intended use of the bar, general parameters of the trading account, and testing process."
